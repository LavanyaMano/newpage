<h2>
    Fifth week in Bootcamp
</h2>
<hr>
This is Django week.

Last We had pair programing in word counter app. Then additions were made to it by making calculator app, timestable and address book app. The whole project was done in flask framework.

This week Heroku was introduced to us. Our OpenWeather app was published in Heroku. New app for getting user's github repositories was also added to our word counter project and posted in Heroku.
A Django tutorial for polls app was given as a weekend work and for intial exposure to django.

Learned to create a Django project from scratch on Monday for a simple project.Then it was developed as a project called bookworm(Maintaining inventory for books in bookshelves of bookcases.)Lab work for Student project was given. The requirments were to get student name, created date, bio and github url of bootcamp students. I was able to create a admin page and display the required details. 

Concept of database was given to understand the bookworm project. Later the bookworm project was expanded with bootstrap templates. And then futher features like forms were added. Forms were added to get user input for bookcases/bookshelves/books etc. from the main page without admin login. 

New project work is now given to create a music app.This is also a group project (with Kelly and our team name is Stuck Flute).The requirements of the project are to get attributes like Album, tracks, artists, etc. We made a relationship diagram for the models. So far we were able to add the album/track/artist/genre attributes from admin page and main template page. We are yet to complete our templating and add the search fields to the pages and finally to post in heroku.

On friday, we went to Space Tango on a field trip. Space Tango sends the research samples  to space stations. They monitor the samples using sensors and receives the datas like temperature, growth or any other relavent attributes. These datas are recevied and stored in their databases and retrieved for calculations/processing for the required purpose. Thus had a glimpse of web tool application (or database/software) in space program.
