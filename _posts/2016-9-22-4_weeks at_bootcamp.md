<h2>
    Four weeks at Bootcamp
</h2>
<hr>

It has been four weeks since the class started.
I remember the week one, stressed & confused. 
Now I feel the opposite. I am feeling more confident.

HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,Jekyll,Python,Flask were taught in the first month. HTML/CSS became so simple to me after I understood Bootstrap. After training for a week and revising sessions I feel confident in creating a web page.

I learned how to look at the components, how to imitate a web-page and how to get page contents like images/icons,etc from a web page. I got to know how to use the inspect element in chrome web browser.

After the learning web page components, we jumped in to Jekyll. Jekyll is a static web page generator. Jekyll was totally new to me. Unlike working in HTML/CSS, where we have to write the scripts, the way Jekyll works is little different. I had trouble understanding Jekyll, like for example I had questions about what is server, why so much folders with specific names to be created, liquid, markdown etc. After working in Flask and Django now I am able slowly get a good grasp of Jekyll.

In week2 we looked at Python and object oriented programming (OOPS). We had morning warmup sessions, in which we were given challenges. I liked to working out those challenges. It was refreshing to work on Python warm-up exercises in the morning. I started googling for built-in python functions and was able to appreciate their usefulness.

Suddenly, in one morning warmup sessions,creating a web page(like pinterest/gmail/) was given as challenge. Working in python for a while, got little hesitant in writing the html/css. I could not complete the task. Then I learned how to read a webpage(as html/css components). I was lagging in planning.

Learned to create apps in python.Learned a lot in just four weeks. Working in team of two is different from working alone. Now I am comfortable in using github also.
