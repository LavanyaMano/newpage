I started using Github for bootcamp pre-work assignment. Since then I used github much for just sending my works to repos. I also tried few things like creating organization, pulling requests, forking, cloning.

I explored github for my main project. I created my project (for agile method). I created wishlist for my projects.
I then created sprint columns. I adapted github project instead trello board, to monitor my project as I commit (like step by step).

I converted the tasks in sprints to issues. Thus I broke down the work into pieces than I can measure for a sprint. Then I commit to close that particular issue.
Even then I find difficulty in monitoring the time for the tasks. Today, I explored milestone option in github. 

I created a milestone with target time. I added the issues(my tasks for the sprint week) to the milestone. For example I created a milestone with a target date of two days from now and I added three of my tasks with I converted into issues to the milestone. Now I have got 3 issues open with target time of two days. 

As I commit & close an issue in that milestone, I can see the progress in time scale.
